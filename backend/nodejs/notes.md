# Node.js

## What is it?

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It runs the V8 JavaScript engine which is the core of Google Chrome.

Node.js is single threaded and because of that I/O primitives from its standard library are asynchronous. Libraries in this ecosystem are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behaviour the exception rather than the norm.
